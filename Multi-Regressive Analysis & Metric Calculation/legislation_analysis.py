    This future addition to the pipeline will feature a large language model (either of our 
    own design, or one already developed that we trust to remain unbiased) that can predict 
    an impact on deforestation trensds simply based on the language of the legislation or 
    company initiative.

    An alternative to this, that will likely prove to be easier to implement, more efficient, 
    and contain less outside dependencies is a language model of our own to analyze sentiment, 
    key-words, etc. and then associate those outputs with a trend in deforestation.

    The underlying principle behind both of these ideas is we're not trying to find a causal 
    relationship to predict. Rather, we are simply finding a correlation between several features 
    present in the language and a change in the rate of deforesation. This allows us to avoid 
    predicting the politics of our world — a very chaotic system — and instead focus on solely 
    associations (no need to find an underlying cause).
